# Mini project assignment 
Create a Result Processing Software: 
Create a structure student with the following members rno, name, marks obtained from five subjects (physics, chemistry, maths, English, Hindi), and maximum marks of each subject. A data file will be prepared to maintain a record of all the students. (At least 5 students) 
The menu-driven program prints the mark sheet.

2. Add a record in a file
3. Update  student record
